Just playing around with rust, tokio and yew
to get a very simple full stack application running.

Most of the code and the ideas are taken from this [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/full-stack-rust-a-complete-tutorial-with-examples).
However, I switched to updated version which, especially for yew
changes a lot.

You will need a postgres db running in port 5432.
